Link to a specific item in a Tabs or Accordion module
You can link to a specific item in the Tabs or Accordion module by setting a custom CSS ID for the module
then use that item's index in the anchor link. 

Indexes start at 0 for the first item in the list, so the first item is 0, the second item is 1, and so on. 

To link to a specific item in a Tabs or Accordion module:

Open the module and click the Advanced tab.
In the ID field, set a unique ID name for the module.
Link to any item in that module by specifying the module’s ID with the item’s index, separated by a vertical slash |.
For example, if you want to link to the second item in a Tabs module with an id of Gallery, use this link:
